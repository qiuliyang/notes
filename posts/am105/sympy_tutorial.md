I like the open source community, so I choose to use `python` instead of `matlab` or `mathematica` to deal with differential equations. 

[`Sympy`](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/solvers/ode.html#) is a very useful, and well documented, package in my experiences of learning some Math courses. It provides some powerful tools to solve math problems analytically. Here is a short tutorial of about solving differential equations with Sympy.
