I will serve as a TF for Harvard AM105, ODEs and PDEs, lectured by Zhigang Suo and Ethan Levian this spring term. 
My previous learning experience of these topics is formalized by a physics-centered course 
*Mathematical Physics Method* (数学物理方法) given in Chinese, which covered topics from complex analysis to solutions of special ODE/PDEs. 
AM105 is a more mathematics-centered course focusing on ODEs and PDEs. 
To get familiar with related English terminologies and more mathematical details, I will spend some time reviewing the textbooks
{% sidenote '1' 'Boyce, William E., Richard C. DiPrima, and Hugo Villagómez Velázquez. *Elementary differential equations and boundary value problems* 2017' %}
{% sidenote '2' 'Haberman, Richard. *Applied partial differential equations* 2003' %}
myself and take notes here. Hope I could be a good TF. 

The syllabus of the AM105 is, according to Zhigang's notes:

1. Intro, Boyce book 1.3
2. Initial value problem (linear), Boyce book 2.1-2.3
3. Existence and uniqueness, aprroximation, linearization stability. Boyce book 2.4-2.5
